Due to the interactions of the corresponding protein with the Factor V protein, SNPs in these two coagulation-related genes are often studied together. In particular, rs1799963 is often studied together with rs6025 . [ PMID 23900608 ]In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of i3002432 / rs1799963 (PT20210A or prothrombin or Factor 2) was based on 9,134 cases and 17,606 controls. The AG variant average risk for Venous Thromboembolism was 2.8, and risk was higher for younger subjects ((< 45 years old, OR: 3.19; ≥ 45 years old, OR: 2.57) and for women taking oral contraceptives (women not using OCs, OR: 2.73; women using OCs, OR: 5.58). Further analysis by outcome revealed that more the risk for Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was highest at 4.4 (based on 303 cases and 2,723 controls), whereas for Venous thromboembolism OR was 3.0, and for Venous thrombosis (w/o pulmonary embolism) OR 2.6. The AA variant risk was 6.74, but the odds ratio for homozygotes was based on only 28 subjects among cases and 4 controls. A larger risk was seen in rs6025 Factor V Leiden SNP variants. For a more complete discussion, see rs6025 . [ PMID 19404532 ],[ PMID 22784820 ] In addition to the literature associating the G20210A variant with thromboembolism in general, several studies have found that this variant significantly (2 - 20 fold) increases the risk for ischemic stroke (aka cerebral ischemia) in individuals with patent foramen ovale (PFO), or hole in the heart.

      " rs1801166 , also known as c.3949G>C, p.Glu1317Gln and E1317Q, represents a rare variant in the APC gene on chromosome 5. There are conflicting views on whether the minor rs1801166 (C) allele increases risk for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a disorder often leading to colorectal cancer . One publication states the presence of this minor allele raises the risk of colon cancer 11 fold; other publications find no increase in risk. Note that normally, APC gene mutations associated with FAP are dominant (and highly penetrant). Given that, the most conservative conclusion would be to say that if it's pathogenic at all, the E1317Q mutation is likely to lead to significantly increased risk primarily in rs1801166 (C;C) homozygotes, but it might also be worth suggesting increased screening for heterozygotes anyway, and most especially for any E1317Q carriers with a family history of colon cancer. 23andMe name: i3002485  [ PMID 9724771 ] The APC variants I1307K and E1317Q are associated with colorectal tumors, but not always with a family history.

      " The chemokine receptor gene CCR5 plays an important role in many immune-related processes.

In patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the major risk is a sudden rupture - which is quite often fatal.
